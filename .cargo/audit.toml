# Cargo audit configuration
# This file configures which advisories to ignore when running `cargo audit`

[advisories]
# Ignore unmaintained crates that don't have security vulnerabilities
# These are warnings only and don't represent actual security issues
ignore = [
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0057",  # fxhash - unmaintained (via selectors -> scraper)
    "RUSTSEC-2024-0436",  # paste - unmaintained (via boa_engine)
]

# Alternatively, you can ignore all unmaintained warnings with:
# ignore-unmaintained = true

# Only fail on vulnerabilities, not warnings
# vulnerability-warnings = false
